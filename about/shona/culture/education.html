      <p>In her introduction, Chipo tells us that she is in Grade 1  and talks about her school, Gweshe   Primary School. </p>
      <p>Zimbabwe's  education system is based on the British system, with 7 years of primary and 6  years of secondary schooling.&nbsp; Classes in  primary school are referred to as &ldquo;grades&rdquo; (<strong>giredhi</strong> in Shona) and in secondary school as &ldquo;forms&rdquo; (<strong>fomu</strong> in Shona).</p>
    <p>Most Zimbabwean children begin Grade 1 when they are six  years old, like Chipo. In rural schools like Gweshe Primary, students begin  learning in Shona, but transition to all reading and writing in English by  Grade 3.&nbsp; In urban areas the medium of  instruction is English, with Shona or Ndebele taught only as a subject.&nbsp; After seven years of primary schooling Chipo  will sit for four nationally-set Grade 7 examinations in Mathematics, English,  Shona or Ndebele, and Content (a combination of sciences and social  sciences).&nbsp; </p></td>

    <td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p>If Chipo goes on to Form 1, when she is 12 or 13 years old,  she can attend a government, private, mission day, or mission boarding  school.&nbsp; Government schools take students  by zone and then allot the rest of the places to those with the best scores on  their Grade 7 examinations. Private, mission day and boarding schools admit  students based on their Grade 7 examination results, interviews, and  school-based placement tests.&nbsp; If Chipo  doesn&rsquo;t pass the Grade 7 examinations she will not go on to secondary school.</p>
      <p>Secondary School consists of three levels: ZJC (Zimbabwe  Junior Certificate) which includes Forms 1 and 2; O level (Ordinary level)  which includes Forms 3 and 4; and A level (Advanced level) which includes Lower  6th Form and Upper 6th Form..&nbsp; In Forms 1 and 2 Chipo will study English,  Shona or Ndebele, Mathematics, Science, History, Geography, Bible Knowledge,  and a practical subject (e.g. Food and Nutrition, Fashion and Fabrics,  Woodwork, Agriculture, Metalwork, or Technical Drawing). </p>
      <p>Based on her Form 1 and 2 reports, Chipo will be assigned to  courses and tracked classes for her O level studies for Forms 3 and 4.&nbsp; In government schools in a rural area like  Gweshe, Chipo will be restricted in their options and usually are only afforded  the opportunity to take 8 or 9 subjects. Private schools often let students  take up to 12 or 13 subjects for O level exams. </p>
      <p>Subjects offered for&nbsp;  O level exams include: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Physics with  Chemistry, Integrated Science, Mathematics; English Literature, Religious  Education, Geography, History, Accounts, Commerce, Economics, Computer Studies,  English, Shona, Ndebele, French, German, Latin, Art, Music, Woodwork,  Metalwork, Agriculture, Technical Drawing, Fashion &amp;&nbsp; Fabrics, and Food &amp; Nutrition</p>
      <p>Chipo will write her O level exams when she is about 15-17  years old.&nbsp; To receive a passing O level  certificate, she must pass at least five subjects including English language  with a mark of C or better.&nbsp; The English  and mathematics O level exams serve as gatekeepers; Chipo won&rsquo;t be able to  proceed without them regardless of her other exam scores, and thus would not continue  into the last two years (A levels) of secondary school.&nbsp; Most O level students return to small-scale  farming, enter the work force, or proceed to a vocational course, a technical  school, or a nursing or teaching college. Only those with the best scores are  admitted to an A level program. </p>
      <p>If she does well enough on O levels to proceed to the A  level, Chipo will choose among science, commercial and art subjects to study  for Lower 6th Form and Upper 6th Form.&nbsp; Most students take three subjects, with a few  students at elite schools opting for four subjects. </p>
      <p>A level subjects currently offered include: English  Literature, Geography, Shona or Ndebele Language and Literature, Divinity,  History, French, Art, Music, Latin, German, Management of Business/Business  Studies, Economics, Accounts, Computer Science, Technical Graphics, Biology,  Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, and Further Mathematics.</p>
      <p>If Chipo does well on her A level exams, she may be accepted  to the University   of Zimbabwe and her course  of study will be dictated by which subjects she passed.</p>
