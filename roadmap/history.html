		<p><b>California Language Roadmap Summit</b><br /><br />

The University of California Consortium for Language Learning & Teaching (Robert
Blake, UC Davis, director) and the Language Acquisition Research Center (Mary
Ann Lyman-Hager, San Diego State University, director) received funding from the
National Security Education Program (NSEP) to develop a roadmap for the study of
world languages in the state of California. Other states that have held NSEP-sponsored
Language Roadmap summits are Ohio, Oregon, Texas, and Utah.<br /><br />

The first step toward developing the California roadmap was a summit meeting "Building
World Citizens for California`s Success" held in San Diego on May 7th, 2010. The
planning committee included the California Foreign Language Project (Duarte Silva,
Stanford University) and the California State University Strategic Language Initiative
(Kim Oanh Nguyen-Lam, CSU Long Beach). The committee invited representatives
from community organizations, education, business, and government to participate in
the summit meeting and begin to formulate an action agenda for policy makers and
educational leaders with the goal of positioning California for leadership in education
and economic and political success in the 21st century.<br /><br />

Former astronaut Jim Neuman, former U.S. ambassador David Lyon, Peter Wang,
president and CEO of the Wang Foundation, and former provost of the Defense
Language Institute Susan Steele were among the keynote speakers who reflected
on the pivotal role of language competence in their professional life and pressed for
expansion and enhancement of language and culture education in California schools.<br /><br />

Roundtable discussions then formulated and proposed next steps in the effort to
design the California Language Roadmap. The summit meeting established a roadmap
task force to carry out a series of short and long-term actions, including: identifying a
champion in the legislature who would sponsor a bill to provide loan forgiveness or
other incentives to encourage language learning; conducting a Corporate Leadership
Forum to establish a public/private partnership committed to educating the public on the
need for linguistic and cultural competence in the workforce of the future; establishing
a commonly recognized Global Citizenship Seal of Excellence for K-12 schools;
developing a post-secondary certification plan to document job applicants` language
and cultural competence.<br /><br />

Due to the size and complexity of the State of California, the May summit was just
the first step in the design of the California Language Roadmap. Next steps involve
identifying advocates in business, education, and government who will promote
implementation of roadmap proposals. A second summit meeting will convene in
September 2010. The slogan for the California Language Roadmap, "World Language
will be a mandatory component throughout grades K-12 and every California college
graduate will attain functional competence in a language in addition to English by 2025,"
will frame the ongoing efforts of the task force. The UC Language Consortium website
(<a href="http://uccllt.ucdavis.edu/">http://uccllt.ucdavis.edu/</a>) will track the progress of the California Language Roadmap.</p>
